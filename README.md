# 2D Platformer Game
## Purpose
The goal for this project is to complete a mobile platform game within a four week timeline. Further maintenance and development should not be required at the end of this project. The target platforms are Android and iOS.

## Tools
The required tools for this project are Unity, GitHub, and a C# compatible IDE or text editor. A GitHub account must be created to gain access to the student license for Unity. The student license will allow access to Unity Pro. Please refer to the setup wiki page to get started. Unity, Youtube, and other online resources are available to help improve understanding of functionality. I highly encourage downloading the available projects and walkthrough the corresponding tutorials in the game engine itself. We will be using a tile-based workflow.

## Requirements
At the end of the four weeks I want a level-based 2D platform game. The user should be able to open the app to the main screen. Listed on the main screen should be:
* Game Title
* "Play Game" button
* Background music toggle button
* Settings cog button
* Level select/progress button

**Player Controls:**
* Analog Stick for left/right movement
* Tap to jump

There should be at least 12 levels for the player to complete. For each five “regular” levels, there will be a “boss” level.

**Regular Level:**
* Player should be able to collect coin-like objects
* Player should encounter at least five enemy objects
  * Player should jump on the enemy object once in order to defeat it
* Player should encounter mid-way checkpoint
  * If the player “dies” beyond this point, the player should respawn at the checkpoint. Else the player should respawn at the level starting point
* Player should reach the end checkpoint to complete level

**Boss Level:**
* Player should be able to collect coin-like objects
* Player should encounter at least seven enemy objects
* Player should encounter mid-way checkpoint
  * If the player “dies” beyond this point, the player should respawn at the checkpoint. Else the player should respawn at the level starting point
* Player should encounter a checkpoint at the boss level
  * If the player “dies” beyond this point, the player should respawn at the checkpoint. Else the player should respawn at the mid-way checkpoint
* Player should defeat the “boss” enemy object to complete the level
  * Player should jump on the boss enemy a total of three times in order to defeat it 

Note: This is an early project brainstorming breakdown. The final project may differ from what has been outlined in this wiki
